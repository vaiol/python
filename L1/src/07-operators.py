# Python Arithmetic Operators
# +	Addition	x + y	
# -	Subtraction	x - y	
# *	Multiplication	x * y	
# /	Division	x / y	
# %	Modulus	x % y	
# **	Exponentiation	x ** y	
# //	Floor division	x // y

# Python Comparison Operators
# =	x = 5	x = 5	
# +=	x += 3	x = x + 3	
# -=	x -= 3	x = x - 3	
# *=	x *= 3	x = x * 3	
# /=	x /= 3	x = x / 3	
# %=	x %= 3	x = x % 3	
# //=	x //= 3	x = x // 3	
# **=	x **= 3	x = x ** 3	
# &=	x &= 3	x = x & 3	
# |=	x |= 3	x = x | 3	
# ^=	x ^= 3	x = x ^ 3	
# >>=	x >>= 3	x = x >> 3	
# <<=	x <<= 3	x = x << 3


# Python Logical Operators

# and 	Returns True if both statements are true	x < 5 and  x < 10	
# or	Returns True if one of the statements is true	x < 5 or x < 4	
# not	Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	not(x < 5 and x < 10)

# Python Identity Operators
# is 	Returns True if both variables are the same object	x is y	
# is not	Returns True if both variables are not the same object	x is not y

# Python Membership Operators
# n 	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object	x in y	
# not in	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object	x not in y

# Python Bitwise Operators
# & 	AND	Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
# |	OR	Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
#  ^	XOR	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
# ~ 	NOT	Inverts all the bits
# <<	Zero fill left shift	Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
# >>	Signed right shift	Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off
